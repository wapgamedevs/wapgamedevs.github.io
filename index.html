          <p>WAP Game is a project made by two best friends, Ethan and Jake. We started the project on the 30th of
            March, 2021 and have been working on it together ever since. Here is a bit about ourselves:</p>

            <p>Hi! My name is Ethan, and I'm a <span id="ethanAge">XX</span> year old software developer currently
              working on my degree in Computer Science. Ive
              been programming and working with computers since age 9, soldered an arduino handheld games console at age
              11, and have made countless applications, websites, games for myself and for others over the years. I also
              create all the music and sound effects for my projects. I am currently developing a new platform, eten,
              and all of my content will be available there soon.
              <br>
              <br>
              For WAP Game, I have written various C# files and worked within the unity engine to help build the game. I
              have conceptualised many characters, drawn their designs, and made world elements too. I manage the mail
              and post on the social media, created this very website and wrote all the music. Together with Jake, I
              also help develop the story and worldbuilding.
              <br>
              <br>
              When Im not programming or making music, I enjoy exploring either on my own, or with Jake. We love to
              experience what my city, those around it, and places far beyond have to offer. I also like to kick back
              and play some Nintendo Switch from time to time, im a big fan of platformers and RPGs.
              <br>
              <br>
              My mission statement is to share what I have to offer with the world. I enjoy creating things, and love to
              see people around me enjoying them too. That being said, I hope you enjoy our game, and everything else we
              have to offer in the future!

            <p>
              Hello! My name is Jake. I’m <span id="jakeAge">XX</span> years old, currently working an entry level job
              in game development with the intention of building a career in the industry. Since I was young, Ive always
              had a drive to make things, from Lego, origami, and arts and crafts, all the way to electronics and even
              air guns using old plumbing parts. The first time I discovered game-dev was through Scratch, and Ive since
              moved on to more serious tools like the Unity Engine.
              <br>
              <br>
              Concerning my role in WAP Game, Im responsible for the games artwork, as well as the majority of the
              programming and editor side of development. I also like to get my hands dirty with story, worldbuilding,
              and concept design alongside Ethan.
              <br>
              <br>
              If Im not spending my free time on game-dev, youre likely to find me climbing, indoors as well as out;
              knitting a new jumper; reading books on philosophy; or spending time with my best friend Ethan. (youve met
              him already) My favourite film involves a flying pig who catches seaplane pirates.
              <br>
              <br>
              I see my contribution towards WAP Game as a magnum opus of everything Ive learned about game development
              over the last few years. With both our skillsets to complement each other, I know that the finished
              product will be everything we hoped for, and more.
